After the turn ends, the Cytoshaped Myr Propagator reverts back to what it was, but the token will stay as it is. Also, if the copy ability of a creature (such as Cemetery Puca, perhaps) makes it become a copy of Myr Propagator and gain another ability, the token created by this creature's ability will be a Myr Propagator with that additional ability."
